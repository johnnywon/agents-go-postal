# Changelog

Versions follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). Before 1.0, a minor version can break things. Each entry names any new D1 migration: apply it with `wrangler d1 migrations apply <db> --remote` before you deploy that version.

## 0.1.1

- CI: tests, typecheck and build run on every pull request and every push to `main`.
- `package.json` carries the version.

## 0.1.0

First tagged version, at `465b00b`. One list for every address, labels and bulk actions with undo, scheduled send, the in-app agent, the MCP server, one search language with ranked results, D1 storage with attachment search, Move to Inbox and Empty Trash.

D1 migrations: `0001` to `0004`.
