I lead engineering at Cedar Supply. We run 41 hardware and building-supply stores, and we're building an assistant for store employees. Someone at the contractor desk asks for a stainless lag bolt that fits a particular bracket, and the assistant finds the part, the substitutes and what's on the shelf.

Our catalog comes from about thirty manufacturers, each with its own spreadsheet habits. A colleague saw your talk on the MCP connector and sent me the docs, and the normalized schema looks like the piece we've been missing.

Three questions before I take this to our team:

- Which MCP clients do you support today? Store operations would use Claude, and our help desk is testing ChatGPT.
- Can every answer carry its source? If the assistant recommends a part, staff need to see which manufacturer file it came from.
- How fresh is the data? Some suppliers update prices weekly, and a few change part numbers without telling anyone.

If it fits, we'd like a four-week pilot in five stores starting early October. I'm happy to get on a call next week, any afternoon except Thursday.

Thanks,
Lena`, SIGNERS.lena),

I'm a developer at Procura Works. We build purchasing software for mid-size manufacturers, and I've been testing the Partwell connector in ChatGPT this week.

One thing I couldn't answer from the docs: responses include \`sourceUpdatedAt\`. Does that date apply to the whole catalog a record came from, or to that single record? We need to tell buyers whether a specific price is current, and a catalog-level date could overstate that.

I tried the same lookup in Claude and got the same field, so I assume it comes from the API rather than the client.

If it is catalog-level, is a per-record date on the roadmap?

Thanks, the timing helped me find it.

When an account moves to a paid plan, Partwell issues a new production key, and the trial key keeps working until the trial ends. The dashboard lists each key twice: a key ID that starts with \`key_\`, which is safe to log, and the secret itself, which starts with \`pw_live_\` and is shown once. Your requests since Friday are sending the key ID, which is why they come back as \`invalid_api_key\`.

Open Settings > API keys, choose Reveal on the production key (or roll a new one), and put that value in your Authorization header. Nothing else on the account needs to change.

If it still fails, reply here and I'll go through the request logs with you.

			html: human(`Hi June,

Thanks for the repro. It made this quick to confirm.

Yes, a cursor belongs to the query that created it. It stores the offset and a fingerprint of the filters. In your step 2 the fingerprint didn't match, and the API should have refused the request with \`400 cursor_filter_mismatch\`. Instead it applied the old offset to the new filter, which is why page 2 started 30 records late. That was our bug, and the fix went out at 2:05 pm today (PR 184).

When a filter changes, start a new list without a cursor:

\`GET /v1/parts/search?q=fasteners&manufacturer=hollis&in_stock=true&limit=50\`

then follow that response's \`next_cursor\`. The pagination guide now has this example: https://docs.partwell.dev/guides/pagination#changing-filters

Could you run your sequence again and confirm the in-stock list comes through complete? I'll keep this open until I hear from you.

Sorry for the slow night. Here is what happened.

From 11:37 pm a customer rollout sent about twenty times our normal evening traffic, and parallel lookups with immediate retries multiplied it. Database connections ran out, so single-part reads (\`/v1/parts/{id}\`) queued and some passed your 10-second timeout. Search was slower but mostly completed. No data was lost or changed; the failed requests never ran.

Recovery was recorded at 2:36 am. We added caching for repeated reads, and the customer has lowered their concurrency. For now, each API key is limited to 20 concurrent requests while we watch the next few days. Your sync normally uses 4, so it shouldn't notice.

Please go ahead and restart the sync. If you see timeouts or any 429 responses, reply here and I'll raise your limit straight away.

			html: human(`Hi Alex,

The freshness field is ready for review: https://github.com/alexrivera/partwell/pull/191

Every part record now carries sourceUpdatedAt, the time the manufacturer file it came from last changed, next to sourceFile. A lookup through the MCP connector returns:

\`\`\`
{
  "partNumber": "HX-1420-SS",
  "sourceFile": "atlas/CAT-0930.csv",
  "sourceUpdatedAt": "${c.utc("2026-09-28T10:05")}"
}
\`\`\`

I tested get_part and search_parts from Cursor and from Claude. Two observations:

- Claude quotes the date without being asked when it cites a part ("from Atlas Dataworks' catalog, updated ${c.day("2026-09-28")}"). Cursor shows the field in the tool output, but its agent only mentions it if you ask about freshness. Probably fine, but worth a line in the tool description.
- sourceUpdatedAt is per source file, not per record. For Atlas that's accurate because they send whole batches. For suppliers that patch single rows it can make a price look older than it is, never newer. I'd ship it now and add a per-record date when a supplier gives us one.

Tests cover both tools and the CSV and JSON importers. The CAT-0930 column rename is handled in the same PR, with the old name accepted for one batch.

Happy to pair on the tool description tomorrow if you want.

			html: human(`Hello,

I've opened case DB-4821 for project partwell-prod. Since 11:37 pm Eastern our API has been running out of database connections.

Symptoms:

- The connection pool has been saturated since 11:37 pm: 60 of 60 connections in use, with up to 260 requests waiting.
- p95 time for single-row reads went from 4 ms to about 1.9 s.
- Database CPU is at 92 to 97%. Memory is fine.

The cause on our side: a customer enabled their store assistant in more stores than planned, so traffic is about twenty times the usual evening level. Their client makes parallel lookups and retries immediately on timeout, which multiplies the load. They are lowering their concurrency now, and we're adding a cache for repeated reads.

Two questions:

- Is there a safe pooling or connection setting we should change tonight?
- Do we need a larger compute size for this traffic, and what would it cost?

Metrics for the last 40 minutes are attached.

			html: human(`Hi Alex,

Thanks for the detailed report and the metrics file. I've looked at partwell-prod for case DB-4821.

Your API connects to Postgres directly on port 5432, so every Worker request holds its own connection, and your compute size allows 60 direct connections. That matches the saturation at 23:37.

For tonight, all reversible:

- Point the API at the connection pooler in transaction mode (port 6543) instead of direct connections. Many clients then share a small set of database connections. No schema change is needed.
- Set a 5-second statement timeout for the API's database role, so a stuck query releases its connection instead of holding it.
- Keep your read cache and your customer's lower concurrency. The immediate retries are the biggest multiplier.

On capacity: at twenty times your evening traffic, CPU will stay high on your current size even with pooling. The next compute size doubles CPU and raises direct connections to 120. I estimate ${money(DB_ESTIMATE)} for the rest of this billing month, prorated, and the resize takes about two minutes with a brief reconnect. Let me know if you want it scheduled and I'll keep this case open.

			html: human(`Hi Alex,

Monitoring has been quiet since the recovery early Friday: p95 between 160 and 230 ms all weekend, no 429s, and the read cache is answering about 70% of single-part lookups.

Lena wants to take Cedar's assistant from 5 stores to 15 on Tuesday. Their client is capped at 8 concurrent requests with backoff on retries, and I'd keep that cap for this stage rather than raise it to 16 as they asked. At 15 stores and a cap of 8, the load test peaked at 41% of database CPU.

Can you confirm the cap stays at 8 for Tuesday? I'll reply to Lena once you've decided. A one-word answer is fine.

Priya`),
