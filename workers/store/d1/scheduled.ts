 * Scheduled send on D1, run by the one-minute cron. MailboxDO does this with
 * an alarm at the exact time; on D1 a message goes out up to a minute late.
 *
 * Each run claims due rows before sending (claimed_at), so two overlapping
 * runs can't both send one; the `draft:<id>` send key is the second guard.
 * A claim older than CLAIM_STALE_MS is taken over, in case a run died.
 * Deleting or editing the draft drops its row by foreign key.
